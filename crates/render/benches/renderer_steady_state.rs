//! Steady-state renderer microbenchmarks and the hot-path allocation/dispatch
//! invariant (§7.1, §17.4 — the last Phase 2 exit criterion).
//!
//! Two things are measured here, both through the public API (benches are an
//! external crate and cannot touch `pub(crate)` internals, so we drive whole
//! frames via `Renderer` + the headless backend):
//!
//! 1. An assertion that a warmed-up renderer drawing an unchanged scene
//!    allocates no new GPU resources and emits the same draw calls each frame.
//!    Persistent instance buffers are reused, cached bind groups are reused, and
//!    translucent layers reuse pooled offscreen textures, so the backend's
//!    cumulative buffer/texture/bind-group counts must not grow between frames,
//!    and [`FrameStats`] must be identical. This runs once at startup so a
//!    hot-path regression fails the bench binary immediately (mirroring
//!    `runtime/benches/frame_loop.rs`'s `assert_idle_does_no_work`).
//! 2. The per-frame cost of `upload` (lowering primitives to segments and
//!    uploading instance data) and of a full `upload` + `submit`, as baselines
//!    to catch regressions.
//!
//! Run release (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rust_tmp cargo bench -p viso-render`);
//! criterion defaults to a release profile. Debug timing is not a perf result
//! (§36).
